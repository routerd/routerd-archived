// The network file contains a [Match] section, which determines if a given network file may be applied to a given device; and a [Network] section specifying how the device should be configured. The first (in lexical order) of the network files that matches a given device is applied, all later files are ignored, even if they match as well.
//
// A network file is said to match a network interface if all matches specified by the [Match] section are satisfied.

	MTUBytes string `systemd:",omitempty"`

	// Takes a boolean. If set to true, the ARP (low-level Address Resolution Protocol) for this interface is enabled. When unset, the kernel's default will be used.
	//
	// For example, disabling ARP is useful when creating multiple MACVLAN or VLAN virtual interfaces atop a single lower-level physical interface, which will then only serve as a link/"bridge" device aggregating traffic to the same physical link and not participate in the network otherwise.
	ARP string `systemd:",omitempty"`

	// Takes a boolean. If set to true, the multicast flag on the device is enabled.
	Multicast string `systemd:",omitempty"`

	// Takes a boolean. If set to true, the driver retrieves all multicast packets from the network. This happens when multicast routing is enabled.
	AllMulticast string `systemd:",omitempty"`

	// Takes a boolean. When "yes", no attempts are made to bring up or configure matching links, equivalent to when there are no matching network files. Defaults to "no".
	//
	// This is useful for preventing later matching network files from interfering with certain interfaces that are fully controlled by other applications.
	Unmanaged string `systemd:",omitempty"`

	// Link groups are similar to port ranges found in managed switches. When network interfaces are added to a numbered group, operations on all the interfaces from that group can be performed at once. An unsigned integer in the range 0—4294967294. Defaults to unset.
	Group string `systemd:",omitempty"`

	// Takes a boolean or a minimum operational state and an optional maximum operational state. Please see networkctl(1) for possible operational states. When "yes", the network is deemed required when determining whether the system is online when running systemd-networkd-wait-online. When "no", the network is ignored when checking for online state. When a minimum operational state and an optional maximum operational state are set, "yes" is implied, and this controls the minimum and maximum operational state required for the network interface to be considered online. Defaults to "yes".
	//
	// The network will be brought up normally in all cases, but in the event that there is no address being assigned by DHCP or the cable is not plugged in, the link will simply remain offline and be skipped automatically by systemd-networkd-wait-online if "RequiredForOnline=no".
	RequiredForOnline string `systemd:",omitempty"`
}

// The [SR-IOV] section accepts the following keys. Specify several [SR-IOV] sections to configure several SR-IOVs. SR-IOV provides the ability to partition a single physical PCI resource into virtual PCI functions which can then be injected into a VM. In the case of network VFs, SR-IOV improves north-south network performance (that is, traffic with endpoints outside the host machine) by allowing traffic to bypass the host machine’s network stack.
type SRIOVSection struct {
	// Specifies a Virtual Function (VF), lightweight PCIe function designed solely to move data in and out. Takes an unsigned integer in the range 0..2147483646. This option is compulsory.
	VirtualFunction string `systemd:",omitempty"`

	// Specifies VLAN ID of the virtual function. Takes an unsigned integer in the range 1..4095.

	VLANProtocol string `systemd:",omitempty"`

	// Takes a boolean. Controls the MAC spoof checking. When unset, the kernel's default will be used.
	MACSpoofCheck string `systemd:",omitempty"`

	// Takes a boolean. Toggle the ability of querying the receive side scaling (RSS) configuration of the virtual function (VF). The VF RSS information like RSS hash key may be considered sensitive on some devices where this information is shared between VF and the physical function (PF). When unset, the kernel's default will be used.
	QueryReceiveSideScaling string `systemd:",omitempty"`

	// Takes a boolean. Allows to set trust mode of the virtual function (VF). When set, VF users can set a specific feature which may impact security and/or performance. When unset, the kernel's default will be used.
	Trust string `systemd:",omitempty"`

	// Allows to set the link state of the virtual function (VF). Takes a boolean or a special value "auto". Setting to "auto" means a reflection of the physical function (PF) link state, "yes" lets the VF to communicate with other VFs on this host even if the PF link state is down, "no" causes the hardware to drop any packets sent by the VF. When unset, the kernel's default will be used.
	LinkState string `systemd:",omitempty"`

	// Specifies the MAC address for the virtual function.
	MACAddress string `systemd:",omitempty"`
}

type NetworkSection struct {
	// A description of the device. This is only used for presentation purposes.
	Description string `systemd:",omitempty"`

	// Enables DHCPv4 and/or DHCPv6 client support. Accepts "yes", "no", "ipv4", or "ipv6". Defaults to "no".
	//
	// Note that DHCPv6 will by default be triggered by Router Advertisement, if that is enabled, regardless of this parameter. By enabling DHCPv6 support explicitly, the DHCPv6 client will be started regardless of the presence of routers on the link, or what flags the routers pass. See "IPv6AcceptRA=".
	//
	// Furthermore, note that by default the domain name specified through DHCP is not used for name resolution. See option UseDomains= below.
	//
	// See the [DHCPv4] or [DHCPv6] sections below for further configuration options for the DHCP client support.
	DHCP string `systemd:",omitempty"`

	// Takes a boolean. If set to "yes", DHCPv4 server will be started. Defaults to "no". Further settings for the DHCP server may be set in the [DHCPServer] section described below.
	DHCPServer string `systemd:",omitempty"`

	// Enables link-local address autoconfiguration. Accepts "yes", "no", "ipv4", "ipv6", "fallback", or "ipv4-fallback". If "fallback" or "ipv4-fallback" is specified, then an IPv4 link-local address is configured only when DHCPv4 fails. If "fallback", an IPv6 link-local address is always configured, and if "ipv4-fallback", the address is not configured. Note that, the fallback mechanism works only when DHCPv4 client is enabled, that is, it requires "DHCP=yes" or "DHCP=ipv4". If Bridge= is set, defaults to "no", and if not, defaults to "ipv6".
	LinkLocalAddressing string `systemd:",omitempty"`

	// Specifies how IPv6 link local address is generated. Takes one of "eui64", "none", "stable-privacy" and "random". When unset, the kernel's default will be used. Note that if LinkLocalAdressing= not configured as "ipv6" then IPv6LinkLocalAddressGenerationMode= is ignored.
	IPv6LinkLocalAddressGenerationMode string `systemd:",omitempty"`

	// Takes a boolean. If set to true, sets up the route needed for non-IPv4LL hosts to communicate with IPv4LL-only hosts. Defaults to false.
	IPv4LLRoute string `systemd:",omitempty"`

	// Takes a boolean. If set to true, sets up the default route bound to the interface. Defaults to false. This is useful when creating routes on point-to-point interfaces. This is equivalent to e.g. the following.
	//
	// ip route add default dev veth99
	DefaultRouteOnDevice string `systemd:",omitempty"`
	// Specifies an optional address generation mode and a required IPv6 address. If the mode is present, the two parts must be separated with a colon "mode:address". The address generation mode may be either prefixstable or static. If not specified, static is assumed.
	//
	// When the mode is set to static, or unspecified, the lower bits of the supplied address are combined with the upper bits of a prefix received in a Router Advertisement message to form a complete address. Note that if multiple prefixes are received in an RA message, or in multiple RA messages, addresses will be formed from each of them using the supplied address. This mode implements SLAAC but uses a static interface identifier instead of an identifier generated using the EUI-64 algorithm. Because the interface identifier is static, if Duplicate Address Detection detects that the computed address is a duplicate (in use by another node on the link), then this mode will fail to provide an address for that prefix.
	//
	// When the mode is set to "prefixstable" the RFC 7217 algorithm for generating interface identifiers will be used, but only when a prefix received in an RA message matches the supplied address. See RFC 7217. Prefix matching will be attempted against each prefixstable IPv6Token variable provided in the configuration; if a received prefix does not match any of the provided addresses, then the EUI-64 algorithm will be used to form an interface identifier for that prefix. This mode is also SLAAC, but with a potentially stable interface identifier which does not directly map to the interface's hardware address. Note that the prefixstable algorithm includes both the interface's name and MAC address in the hash used to compute the interface identifier, so if either of those are changed the resulting interface identifier (and address) will change, even if the prefix received in the RA message has not changed. Note that if multiple prefixstable IPv6Token variables are supplied with addresses that match a prefix received in an RA message, only the first one will be used to generate addresses.
	IPv6Token string `systemd:",omitempty"`

	// Takes a boolean or "resolve". When true, enables Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution on the link. When set to "resolve", only resolution is enabled, but not host registration and announcement. Defaults to true. This setting is read by systemd-resolved.service(8).
	LLMNR string `systemd:",omitempty"`

	// Takes a boolean or "resolve". When true, enables Multicast DNS support on the link. When set to "resolve", only resolution is enabled, but not host or service registration and announcement. Defaults to false. This setting is read by systemd-resolved.service(8).
	MulticastDNS string `systemd:",omitempty"`

	// Takes a boolean or "opportunistic". When true, enables DNS-over-TLS support on the link. When set to "opportunistic", compatibility with non-DNS-over-TLS servers is increased, by automatically turning off DNS-over-TLS servers in this case. This option defines a per-interface setting for resolved.conf(5)'s global DNSOverTLS= option. Defaults to false. This setting is read by systemd-resolved.service(8).
	DNSOverTLS string `systemd:",omitempty"`

	// Takes a boolean or "allow-downgrade". When true, enables DNSSEC DNS validation support on the link. When set to "allow-downgrade", compatibility with non-DNSSEC capable networks is increased, by automatically turning off DNSSEC in this case. This option defines a per-interface setting for resolved.conf(5)'s global DNSSEC= option. Defaults to false. This setting is read by systemd-resolved.service(8).
	DNSSEC string `systemd:",omitempty"`

	// A space-separated list of DNSSEC negative trust anchor domains. If specified and DNSSEC is enabled, look-ups done via the interface's DNS server will be subject to the list of negative trust anchors, and not require authentication for the specified domains, or anything below it. Use this to disable DNSSEC authentication for specific private domains, that cannot be proven valid using the Internet DNS hierarchy. Defaults to the empty list. This setting is read by systemd-resolved.service(8).
	DNSSECNegativeTrustAnchors string `systemd:",omitempty"`

	// Controls support for Ethernet LLDP packet reception. LLDP is a link-layer protocol commonly implemented on professional routers and bridges which announces which physical port a system is connected to, as well as other related data. Accepts a boolean or the special value "routers-only". When true, incoming LLDP packets are accepted and a database of all LLDP neighbors maintained. If "routers-only" is set only LLDP data of various types of routers is collected and LLDP data about other types of devices ignored (such as stations, telephones and others). If false, LLDP reception is disabled. Defaults to "routers-only". Use networkctl(1) to query the collected neighbor data. LLDP is only available on Ethernet links. See EmitLLDP= below for enabling LLDP packet emission from the local system.
	LLDP string `systemd:",omitempty"`

	// Controls support for Ethernet LLDP packet emission. Accepts a boolean parameter or the special values "nearest-bridge", "non-tpmr-bridge" and "customer-bridge". Defaults to false, which turns off LLDP packet emission. If not false, a short LLDP packet with information about the local system is sent out in regular intervals on the link. The LLDP packet will contain information about the local hostname, the local machine ID (as stored in machine-id(5)) and the local interface name, as well as the pretty hostname of the system (as set in machine-info(5)). LLDP emission is only available on Ethernet links. Note that this setting passes data suitable for identification of host to the network and should thus not be enabled on untrusted networks, where such identification data should not be made available. Use this option to permit other systems to identify on which interfaces they are connected to this system. The three special values control propagation of the LLDP packets. The "nearest-bridge" setting permits propagation only to the nearest connected bridge, "non-tpmr-bridge" permits propagation across Two-Port MAC Relays, but not any other bridges, and "customer-bridge" permits propagation until a customer bridge is reached. For details about these concepts, see IEEE 802.1AB-2016. Note that configuring this setting to true is equivalent to "nearest-bridge", the recommended and most restricted level of propagation. See LLDP= above for an option to enable LLDP reception.
	EmitLLDP string `systemd:",omitempty"`

	// A link name or a list of link names. When set, controls the behavior of the current link. When all links in the list are in an operational down state, the current link is brought down. When at least one link has carrier, the current interface is brought up.
	BindCarrier string `systemd:",omitempty"`

	// A static IPv4 or IPv6 address and its prefix length, separated by a "/" character. Specify this key more than once to configure several addresses. The format of the address must be as described in inet_pton(3). This is a short-hand for an [Address] section only containing an Address key (see below). This option may be specified more than once.
	//
	// If the specified address is "0.0.0.0" (for IPv4) or "::" (for IPv6), a new address range of the requested size is automatically allocated from a system-wide pool of unused ranges. Note that the prefix length must be equal or larger than 8 for IPv4, and 64 for IPv6. The allocated range is checked against all current network interfaces and all known network configuration files to avoid address range conflicts. The default system-wide pool consists of 192.168.0.0/16, 172.16.0.0/12 and 10.0.0.0/8 for IPv4, and fd00::/8 for IPv6. This functionality is useful to manage a large number of dynamically created network interfaces with the same network configuration and automatic address range assignment.
	Address string `systemd:",omitempty"`

	// The gateway address, which must be in the format described in inet_pton(3). This is a short-hand for a [Route] section only containing a Gateway key. This option may be specified more than once.
	Gateway string `systemd:",omitempty"`

	// A DNS server address, which must be in the format described in inet_pton(3). This option may be specified more than once. Each address can optionally take a port number separated with ":", a network interface name or index separated with "%", and a Server Name Indication (SNI) separated with "#". When IPv6 address is specified with a port number, then the address must be in the square brackets. That is, the acceptable full formats are "111.222.333.444:9953%ifname#example.com" for IPv4 and "[1111:2222::3333]:9953%ifname#example.com" for IPv6. This setting can be specified multiple times. If an empty string is assigned, then the all previous assignments are cleared. This setting is read by systemd-resolved.service(8).
	DNS string `systemd:",omitempty"`

	// A whitespace-separated list of domains which should be resolved using the DNS servers on this link. Each item in the list should be a domain name, optionally prefixed with a tilde ("~"). The domains with the prefix are called "routing-only domains". The domains without the prefix are called "search domains" and are first used as search suffixes for extending single-label hostnames (hostnames containing no dots) to become fully qualified domain names (FQDNs). If a single-label hostname is resolved on this interface, each of the specified search domains are appended to it in turn, converting it into a fully qualified domain name, until one of them may be successfully resolved.
	//
	// Both "search" and "routing-only" domains are used for routing of DNS queries: look-ups for hostnames ending in those domains (hence also single label names, if any "search domains" are listed), are routed to the DNS servers configured for this interface. The domain routing logic is particularly useful on multi-homed hosts with DNS servers serving particular private DNS zones on each interface.
	//
	// The "routing-only" domain "~." (the tilde indicating definition of a routing domain, the dot referring to the DNS root domain which is the implied suffix of all valid DNS names) has special effect. It causes all DNS traffic which does not match another configured domain routing entry to be routed to DNS servers specified for this interface. This setting is useful to prefer a certain set of DNS servers if a link on which they are connected is available.
	//
	// This setting is read by systemd-resolved.service(8). "Search domains" correspond to the domain and search entries in resolv.conf(5). Domain name routing has no equivalent in the traditional glibc API, which has no concept of domain name servers limited to a specific link.
	Domains string `systemd:",omitempty"`

	// Takes a boolean argument. If true, this link's configured DNS servers are used for resolving domain names that do not match any link's configured Domains= setting. If false, this link's configured DNS servers are never used for such domains, and are exclusively used for resolving names that match at least one of the domains configured on this link. If not specified defaults to an automatic mode: queries not matching any link's configured domains will be routed to this link if it has no routing-only domains configured.
	DNSDefaultRoute string `systemd:",omitempty"`

	// An NTP server address (either an IP address, or a hostname). This option may be specified more than once. This setting is read by systemd-timesyncd.service(8).
	NTP string `systemd:",omitempty"`

	// Configures IP packet forwarding for the system. If enabled, incoming packets on any network interface will be forwarded to any other interfaces according to the routing table. Takes a boolean, or the values "ipv4" or "ipv6", which only enable IP packet forwarding for the specified address family. This controls the net.ipv4.ip_forward and net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding sysctl options of the network interface (see ip-sysctl.txt for details about sysctl options). Defaults to "no".

	// Configures use of stateless temporary addresses that change over time (see RFC 4941, Privacy Extensions for Stateless Address Autoconfiguration in IPv6). Takes a boolean or the special values "prefer-public" and "kernel". When true, enables the privacy extensions and prefers temporary addresses over public addresses. When "prefer-public", enables the privacy extensions, but prefers public addresses over temporary addresses. When false, the privacy extensions remain disabled. When "kernel", the kernel's default setting will be left in place. Defaults to "no".
	IPv6PrivacyExtensions string `systemd:",omitempty"`

	// Takes a boolean. Controls IPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) reception support for the interface. If true, RAs are accepted; if false, RAs are ignored. When RAs are accepted, they may trigger the start of the DHCPv6 client if the relevant flags are set in the RA data, or if no routers are found on the link. The default is to disable RA reception for bridge devices or when IP forwarding is enabled, and to enable it otherwise. Cannot be enabled on bond devices and when link local addressing is disabled.

	// Also see ip-sysctl.txt in the kernel documentation regarding "accept_ra", but note that systemd's setting of 1 (i.e. true) corresponds to kernel's setting of 2.
	//
	// Note that kernel's implementation of the IPv6 RA protocol is always disabled, regardless of this setting. If this option is enabled, a userspace implementation of the IPv6 RA protocol is used, and the kernel's own implementation remains disabled, since systemd-networkd needs to know all details supplied in the advertisements, and these are not available from the kernel if the kernel's own implementation is used.

	IPv4ProxyARP string `systemd:",omitempty"`

	// Takes a boolean. Configures proxy NDP for IPv6. Proxy NDP (Neighbor Discovery Protocol) is a technique for IPv6 to allow routing of addresses to a different destination when peers expect them to be present on a certain physical link. In this case a router answers Neighbour Advertisement messages intended for another machine by offering its own MAC address as destination. Unlike proxy ARP for IPv4, it is not enabled globally, but will only send Neighbour Advertisement messages for addresses in the IPv6 neighbor proxy table, which can also be shown by ip -6 neighbour show proxy. systemd-networkd will control the per-interface `proxy_ndp` switch for each configured interface depending on this option. When unset, the kernel's default will be used.

When set to "dhcp-on-stop", systemd-networkd will not drop addresses and routes on stopping the daemon. When "dhcp", the addresses and routes provided by a DHCP server will never be dropped even if the DHCP lease expires. This is contrary to the DHCP specification, but may be the best choice if, e.g., the root filesystem relies on this connection.
